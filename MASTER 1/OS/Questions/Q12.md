# Q12 : Discuss the general organisation of mass storage and its impact on OS design.

> To get more information, see [Magnetic disks](../Notion/Magnetic%20disks.md) and [SSD](../Notion/SSD.md)

- mass storage can be used without file system (raw) or with a file system (formatted)
- There is two types of mass storage used today

## SSD

- Don't use magnetic disks
- much faster
- much more expensive
- can be connected on the PCI to have more speed

## Magnetic disk

- Slow
- Cheap
- want to minimise seek time (time to go to a cylinder)
- When the mass storage is busy, the os put the requests in a queue
- The os uses algorithm to minimise seek time :
	- FCFC : first come first served
	- SSTF : shortestr seek time first
	- scan : go from one side to another in loop and make request that are on path
	- c-scan : same as scan but dont make request on the return path
	- c-look : Arm only goes as far as the last request in each direction, then reverses direction immediately, without first going all the way to the end of the disk
- Disk structure :
	- Disk can be seen as a big array of logical blocks (smaller unit of the disk)
	- this big array is mapped into sectors
	- We can make logical disk using partitions that are a groupe of cylenders
- Disk management :
	- Low level formatting : dividing disk into sectors that contains header informations of data
	- Logical formatting : grouping sectors into clusters, is used by file system
