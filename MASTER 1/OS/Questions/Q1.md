# Q1 : How does an OS interact with its environment ?

It can interact with I/O devices or with user programs

## Interaction with user programs

### From User to Kernel

A user program (in user mode) can call a syscall to ask the kernel to do a task that the user program can not make by itself.

To execute a syscall, the mode bit of the CPU must be on kernel mode. So, How to switch from User mode to Kernel mode?

1. The process ask to the system call interface to execute a syscall with the given arguments (by register or pointer)
2. A trap (interrupt triggered by user) will be send to the CPU
3. This trap will be processed by the interrupt handler in kernel mode. It will look at the type of the trap and see that it is a syscall
4. The kernel will look to the syscall number and execute de corresponding code with the corresponding arguments
5. Finaly, it will return after switching the mod bit to user mode

### From Kernel to User

The kernel will schedule the process that are running (work of the process scheduler). It will place PCB of processes in queues to manage when a processor can run and when not. There is two types of queues :

- Wait queue : queue that stores all processes that are waiting an event (interrupt)
- Ready queue : queue that stores all processes that are ready to execute

To switch from a process to another, it must perform a context switch. It saves the state (registers, etc) of the previous process inside its PCB and load the state of the next process from its PCB

## Interaction with I/O devices

All I/O devices are handle by the device controller (that contains its own OS). So, the kernel speaks with all device controller to perform I/O operations

### From Device controller to Kernel

The device controller speaks to the kernel using interrupt. When it want to speak :

1. it send an interrupt, with the wanted data, to the CPU. 
2. The CPU will transfers control to the interrupt handler
3. The interrupt handler will look at its interrupt vector that give the location of the code to be executed from the interrupt number
4. The interrupt handle will execute this code
5. The CPU will resume the interrupted task

If the data is to big, the device controller can send all the data on the main memory (without using the CPU) and give a pointer to this data with the interrupt
