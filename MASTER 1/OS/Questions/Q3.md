# Q3 : Describe the concept of a process and its implications on the OS.

## What is a process ?

A process is the OS repr√©sentation of a program. A program become a process when an executable file is loader into memory

Process in memory :

All information associated with a process is stored in a PCB. A PCB is composed of :

- Process state
	- New : The process is being created
	- Running : Instructions are being executed
	- Waiting : The process is waiting for some event to occur
	- Ready : The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
	- Terminated : The process has finished execution
- Process ID (pid)
- PC
- CPU register
- and more

One program can be several processes (exemple : chrome). These processes are cooperating, they communicates with IPC. this communication permit to : share informations, speedup, modularity and convenience

## Process creation

A process (child) is create from on other process (parent) with the syscall fork(). When it is created, the child shared the same memory than the parent and execute de same program. To load a program in de child, we must call the syscall exec(). The parent can wait its children by using the syscall wait().

## Process termination

When a process finished what it must do, it asks the Operating system to delete it (using exit() System call in UNIX). When the process is terminated, it returns the status data to its parent (via wait()) and its resources are de-allocated by the Operating system

Parent can terminate the execution of a children using kill() System call

If a parent terminate before its children and great-children, some Operating system will terminate them by itself (cascading termination)

If no parent is waiting a Process, this Process is called zombie

If a Process terminate without waiting its children, these children are called orphans (linux re-parent them to init Process)

## Process scheduler

The process scheduler selects among available processes for next execution on one CPU. it's goal is to maximise CPU use

To do its job, it puts PCB in scheduling queues :

- Wait queue : queue that stores all processes that are waiting an event (interrupt)
- Ready queue : queue that stores all processes that are ready to execute
