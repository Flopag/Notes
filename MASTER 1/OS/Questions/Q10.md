> To get more information, see [Directory](../Notion/Directory.md)

- A directory is a node of the directory structure that contains information about files
- It is located in the file system
- It is used to make file searching more convenient (better organisation)
- A directory can contain or be linked to sub directories and files (shortcuts in windows)
- Directories are structured as tree
- To navigate into the directory structure, use of path
- path can be relative or absolute
- Suppress directory will suppress all sub directories and files in it (not linked one)
- Link has name and and point to a sub directory or a file that is in an other place
- Every time a link is added, a cycle detection algorithm can be run
