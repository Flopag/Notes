# Q11 : Discuss the general organisation of a filesystem and its implementation

> To get more information, see [File system](../Notion/File%20system.md), [Files Allocation](../Notion/Concepts/Files%20Allocation.md)

- A file system is a the system that handle files and directories of a partition
- file system is located in secondary storage
- It stores file control block that contain :
	- file permission
	- file owner
	- file size
	- where is the file
	- etc
- The file system can be log structured: 
	- All update are transaction
	- All transaction is put is the log
	- All log transaction is handle asynchronously
	- when a transaction is done, it is remove from log
	- If crash $\rightarrow$ transaction still on log

## Free space management

- Using a bit vector : bit $i$ of the bit vector of same size than the number of block = 0 if full = 1 if empty
	- hoverhead but easy to find contiguous blocks
- Using linked list : a linked list of all free blocks
	- no overhead but hard to find contiguous blocks

## File allocation

- Contiguous allocation : a file takes contiguous blocks
	- file characterised by its begin address and its size
- Linked allocation : a file is seen as a linked list
	- File characterised by its begin address
	- to get file, must follow the linked list
- Index allocation : use a block to make an index table that contains all block that is making the file in the right order
