# Q1 : What happens when you switch your computer on?

1. Power-up (related electronic stuff)
    - Computer supplies power to its coponents (CPU, RAM, Motherboard, ...)
    - **may have some question about computation structure (how cpu work, cashes, cashline, interrupt, ...)**
2. BIOS (UEFI, must do some research by our self)
    - Basic input output system
    - located ROM/EEPROM (/ ! \ not a RAM)
    - objectives:
        - system check (is all the copenents working?)
        - looks for a bootable divices
            - one the disk (HDD/SSD)
            - USB/CD
    - MBR (master boot record)
        - BIOS
        - UEFI (/ ! \ do not use MBR, must do research)
    - **may ask about partition, disk, File, ...**
3. MBR
  - Special boot sector this is located at the begining of the disk
      - use the first addressable address (CHS 0 0 1 -> C = sector, H = Head, S = sector)
  - Contain 3 parts
      - Bootcode, bootloader (related)
      - Partition table, the partition of the system
      - The magic word, a specific flag that mean that is a bootable disk
  - figure: | Boot | Partition table | Magic word |
  - **may ask about partition, disk, File, ...**
4. bootloader (consider linux and not win or mac)
    - GRUB (or LILO)
    - Small peace of code to bootstrap the system
    - divided into 2 part:
        - GRUB1, small, do a jump to GRUB2
        - GRUB2, main part, contains all operations of bootloader
        - Why 2 GRUB? because bootcode is limited to a small size, so it do just a jump to main code
    - Objectif, Select and boot the kernel
    - **may ask BIOS vs Bootloader vs Kernel (/!\ each are OS)**
5. Kernel loading / bootstraping
    1. InitWamfs is loaded during kernel bootstraping, contains 2 minimal set of tools and drivers to load file system 
    1. Mount the root filesystem and programs of the OS
    1. Init system
        - run backround services
            - core serveces: Clock, network, ...
            - Some script to configure the system
    1. Login screen (graphic or terminal)
    - may ask about process
