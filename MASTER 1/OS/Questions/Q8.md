# Q8 : Can a program whose logical address space id 4GB run on a 2GB-RAM machine? If yes, how?

Yes, logical address space can be bigger than  combine with page replacement)
physical address space thanks to virtual address space (demand paging : swapping)

- Virtual address space make translation between logical address space and physical address space
- Virtual address space can be made by demand paging (bring pages into memory when it is needed), so we don't need all page to be in physical memory :
	- If page in page table $\rightarrow$ works normally
	- If page not in page table $\rightarrow$ 
		- if page in main memory $\rightarrow$ update page table
		- if page in secondary memory $\rightarrow$ bring it to main memory and update page table

## What if no more free space?

- We must replace a page by an other
- We choose a target with an algorithm :
	- FIFO : first in first out
	- MFU : most frequently used out
	- LRU : least frequently used out
	- LRU approximation : use of reference bit :
		- reference bit initialised to 0 (must be targeted)
		- reference bit set to 1 if hit in page table
		- target chosen randomly
	 - LRU approximation (secondary chance) :
		 - target chosen in queue
		 - If it look to a reference bit set to 1 $\rightarrow$ set it to 0
		 - If it look to a 0 $\rightarrow$ target it
	- LRU approximation (secondary chance bis) :
		- same as the other but use the dirty bit to make better choices
	- Optimal: choose the better target
