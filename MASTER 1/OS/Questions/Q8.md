# Q8 : Can a program whose logical address space id 4GB run on a 2GB-RAM machine? If yes, how?

Yes, logical address space can be bigger than physical address space thanks to virtual address space (demand paging : swapping combine with page replacement)

see [Virtual address space](../Notion/Virtual%20address%20space.md), [Swapping](../Notion/Concepts/Swapping.md), [Page fault](../Notion/Page%20fault.md) and [Page replacement](../Notion/Concepts/Page%20replacement.md)
