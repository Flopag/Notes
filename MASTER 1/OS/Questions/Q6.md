# Q6 : Discuss the principles of multi-threading.

> To get more information, see [Thread](../Notion/Thread.md) and [CPU scheduler](../Notion/CPU%20scheduler.md)

## principle

- Multi-threading means using multiple threads to run a process
- Thread is a way to execute a single process with multiple PC
- Threads share the address space of the process except the stack and thread local memory (register, etc)
- Why multi-threading?
	- Responsiveness (can compute something when some threads are blocked)
	- Resource sharing (threads shared easily between them)
	- Economy (much less cost on the creation of a new thread than for a processes)
- Thread can be terminated by killing it (brutal) or by asking it (waiting that it wants to finished)
- There are user threads (user level) and kernel threads (kernel level)
- Relation between user and kernel threads can be many to one, one to one, and many to many

## Scheduling threads

- Burst time = time that a thread will take
- CPU scheduler selects threads from ready queue thanks to these algorithm :
	- FCFS : First come First Served
	- SJF : little burst before
	- Shortest remaining time first : approximation of SJF thanks to previous burst time
	- RR : each time quantum q, take an other thread
	- Priority : priority threads before
	- Priority + RR : Priority threads before, if same priority $\rightarrow$ RR
	- Multilevel feedback queue : Use of multiple queues with above scheduling
