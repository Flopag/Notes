# Q13 : A USB stick is inserted in an up-and-running computer. What happens next?

1. The device controller that control the USB stick send an interrupt to the CPU to that say that the USB stick is inserted
2. The CPU will (if no other interrupt is handled currently) make a context switch and give the interrupt to the interrupt handle of the os
3. The interrupt handle will look what is the type of the interrupt (with the interrupt vector) and sends it to the right part of the interrupt handler
4. After the interrupt finished its job, the CPU makes an other context switch 
5. If the USB stick is formatted, The OS will mount the file system on a node made for this
