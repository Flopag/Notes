# Q9 : Would you expect some performance difference between merge-sort and heap-sort, while both have O(n log n) complexity? Why?

Merge-sort is a recursive algorithm that compare two arrays that are more and more big from beginning to end

Heap-sort is an algorithme that compare node of a heap (can be far away in the array, ""random"" distance between two read operations)

Merge sort will have a much better performance due to [Page replacement](../Notion/Concepts/Page%20replacement.md). Merge sort will leads to less page faults.

Merge sort needs less to have access to a new page because when it use a page, the process will stay on the frame for all or a part of it. (**locality principle**)

Heap sort will use data from multiple pages at a time. that leads to a big amount of page faults
