# Q15 : Describe the different types of virtualization and discuss their pros and cons.

> To get more information, see [Virtualisation](../Notion/Concepts/Virtualisation.md)

## Emulation

- Emulate an OS as a process
- Advantages :
	- Simple to make
- Disadvantages :
	- Very slow

## Container-based OS Virtualisation

- Virtualised OS are in virtual environment (VE)
- VE is seen by the host kernel as a group of processes
- the host see the init [Process](../Process.md) of a VE as a simple process in its [Process](../Process.md) tree and the root of a VE as a simple folder
- Advantages :
	- Fast
	- lightweight
- Disadvantages :
	- All VE must be with the same [Kernel](../Kernel.md) (but can have different distribution, for example : ubuntu debian)

## System virtualisation

- Kernel mode is no more a privilege mode
- the hypervisor is on privilege mode
- Kernel must trap the hypervisor to makes privileged operations
- Advantages :
	- Easy if all instruction that modify resource configuration are privileged (because hypervisor will then have control to sensitive instruction)
- Disadvantages :
	- On x86, not all control sensitive instruction are privileged (these will not trap) so VMs could change some system configuration at will
	- The guest Operating system runs in a Virtual address space is set up by the hypervisor. So, Physical address space  of these VM are Virtual address space. The mapping is managed by  the hypervisor

###  System virtualisation : Binary rewriting

- To avoid privileged issues, privileged instruction and jumps (needs to scan target location) are emulated by replacing them in execution time (thanks to breakpoints registers)
- Advantages :
	- No hardware support required
	- Runs original code
- Disadvantages :
	- Permormance penalty (but better than emulation)
	- Require on-the-fly x86-to-x86 binary compile (to execute breakpoints)

###  System virtualisation : paravirtualisation

- Ignore issues with non-privileged instructions, let the guest Operating system deal with them
- Hypervisor exposes a set of hypercalls
- same principle as binary rewriting but instruction replacement happens at compile-time
- Advantages :
	- No hardware support required
	- Performance
- Disadvantages :
	- Require to modify guest Kernel
