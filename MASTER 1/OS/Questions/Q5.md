# Q5 : Describe mechanisms for inter-process communications(IPC).

> To get more information, see [IPC](../Notion/Concepts/IPC.md)

## Shared memory

- One memory for multiple processes
- Control by processes, not the OS
- Done by giving a copy of the address space from fork
- Difficulty = concurrency (parallel programming)

## Message passing

- Processes communicates trough communication links
- Communication link are handled by the kernel
- Message passing can be blocking (wait) or non blocking (don't wait)
- The communication can be :
	- Direct, Two processes communicates without intermediate, thanks to :
		- `send(P, message)`
		- `receive(Q, message)`
	- Indirect, Multiple processes communicate with an intermediate (mailbox)
		- Operations :
			- Create a new mailbox
			- Delete a mailbox
			- `send(A, message)` 
			- `receive(A, message)` 
		- Who get the message ?
			- If mailbox connected to 2 processes $\rightarrow$ trivial
			- If mailbox has 1 process that listen $\rightarrow$ trivial
			- else (multiple processes are listening) $\rightarrow$ select arbitrarily the receiver
- Pipe can be used to make direct message passing, two kinds of pipe :
	- ordinary pipes is made of an input side and a output side (unidirectional). it is used to communicates between parent and children (because the other process must have one of the pipe side, input or output) 
	- Named pipe can be accessed without parent child relationship (just need the name) and is bidirectional
