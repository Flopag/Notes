# Q7 : Describe how dynamic memory allocation is supported in the kernel.

> To get more information, see [Frames allocation](../Notion/Concepts/Frames%20allocation.md)

- Two types of dynamic memory allocation in the kernel


## Buddy system allocation

- Main memory is allocated using power of 2
- Allocation made by dividing of a frame into two buddies of the same size en repeat it until we cannot divide it anymore (the wanted memory is too big for it)
- easy to organise 
- leads to internal fragmentation

## Slap allocation

- A slab is multiple contiguous frames
- When a slab is created, it empty
- Slab can be filled with objects
- It is use to allocate memory that is needed in the future (pre-allocation)
- if no more slab, must allocate more slabs
- Leads to fast memory request satisfaction (because pre-allocated)
