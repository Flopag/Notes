# Context switch

Context switch is the processus that permit to switch from a [Process](../Process.md) to another. It must save the state ([PCB](../PCB.md)) of the old [Process](../Process.md) and load the saved state for the new [Process](../Process.md)

This makes a lot of overhead while switching
