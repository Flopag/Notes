# Interrupt

An interrupt is a signal from a [Device controller](Device%20controller.md) to the [CPU](CPU.md)

Interrupt transfers control to the [Interrupt handler](Interrupt%20handler.md)

A **trap** or **exception** is an « interrupt » caused by software activity, either by an error or a user request
