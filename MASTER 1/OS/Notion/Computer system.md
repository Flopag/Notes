# Computer system

Computer system can be divided into four components :

- Hardware : provides basic computing resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices, ...)
- [Operating system](Operating%20system.md) : coordinate the hardware and application
- Application programs : solve the computing problems of the users (Compilers, web browser, video games, ...)
- Users (People, machine, ...)
