## File Sharing

Sharing can be done through a protection scheme. If the system is used by multiple users, the system needs :

- User IDs to identify users. Permit to manage permission among users
- Group IDs to identify groups of users. Do the same as User IDs but permit to manage multiple users at a time
- Owner of a [File](File.md)/[Directory](Directory.md)

Protection is controlled by the owner. It can be done with a access mode that say if :

- Can read
- Can write
- Can execute
