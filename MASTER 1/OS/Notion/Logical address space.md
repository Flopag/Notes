## Logical address space for [Paging](Concepts/Paging.md)

The address is divided in two parts :

- **Page number p** : the index of the wanted [page](Concepts/Paging.md) in the [Page table](Page%20table.md)
- **Page offset d** : is the offset used with the output of the [Page table](Page%20table.md) to make the wanted [Physical address](Physical%20address%20space.md)
