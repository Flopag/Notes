# Solid-State Disk (SSD)

SSD is a type of [NVM](NVM.md) that is used in the same what that [HDD](HDD.md). It don't use [Magnetic disks](Magnetic%20disks.md) to store data. so : 

- Can be more reliable
- More expensive per MB
- Can have shorter life span
- Much faster

Sometimes, [I/O bus](I%20O%20devices.md) are too slow to handle a SSD. So, we can connect directly the SSD to the PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)
