# Chapter 4: Nearest neighbour methods

> How to choose a value for $k$?


> Asymptotic ($N \rightarrow \infty$) properties of 1-NN vs k-NN
> - Under which condition is 1-NN asymptotically consistent?
> - Explain why: $k(N) \rightarrow \infty$ and $\frac {k(N)} N \rightarrow 0$ => optimal method (minimum error)


> Discuss computational complexity and interpretability
