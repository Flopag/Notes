# Q5 : Variance reduction techniques

> **Variance reduction techniques**: techniques to reduce variance in the context of the different learning algorithms covered in the course (regularization, complexity control, ensemble methods, feature selection), discussion and comparison of the different learning algorithms from the point of view of their bias and variance.

## Regularization

Reduce the size of the hypothesis space

## Complexity control

## Ensemble methods

## Feature selection

## Comparison of the different learning algorithm
