# Q11 : Support vector machines

> **Support vector machines**: main notions (classification margin, optimization problem, support vectors, soft margin), general idea of the kernel trick.

## Main notions

### Classification margin

The margin is the width that the boundary could be increased by before hitting a data-point

We search the linear classifier with the biggest margin

### Optimisation problem

### Support vectors

### Soft margin

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- State-of-the-art accuracy on many problems
- Can handle any data types by changing the kernel

Cons:
- Tuning the method parameter is very crucial to get good results and somewhat tricky
- Black-box models, not easy to interpret

## Kernel trick

for non linear boundary, we can remap the data into a new feature space where the boundary is linear
