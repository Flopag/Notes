# Q1 : Machine learning protocols

> **Machine learning protocols**: supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, batch vs online learning, semi-supervised and transductive learning. Give an example of one practical problem and of one method for each protocol.

## Supervised learning and unsupervised learning

The goal is, from the database, to find a function f (Â·) of the inputs that
approximates at best the output.

Unsupervised learning tries to find any regularities in the data without guidance about inputs and outputs (try to make relation between variables)

## Reinforcement learning

The model learns from interactions

The goal is ti choose sequences of actions (= policy) that maximizes the result (?)

## Batch vs online learning

Batch learning: all learning examples are supposed to be accessible (in memory) for training the model

On-line learning: examples are treated one by one

On-line learning permit to learn with streamed data, and also, big data (that are too large to store in memory)

## Semi-supervised

Semi-supervised learning: exploit both labeled and unlabeled data to build better models than using each one alone (unlabeled data is an input-output pair without output)

## Transductive learning

Transductive learning: supervised learning but we have access to the test data from the beginning and we want to exploit it

We don't want a model but to compute predictions for the unlabeled data. This can be made by training a semi-supervised model and use it to predict unlabeled data. There is also methods that don't need to train models (graph-based algorithms, ...)
