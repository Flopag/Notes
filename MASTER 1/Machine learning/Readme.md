## Questions

For all methods, you should be able provide their **main drawbacks** and **strengths** (with respect to other algorithms), assess the **effect of their main hyper-parameters on bias and variance**, and discuss their **computational complexity**.

1. [**Machine learning protocols**](Questions/Q1.md): supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, batch vs online learning, semi-supervised and transductive learning. Give an example of one practical problem and of one method for each protocol.
2. [**Model evaluation criteria**](Questions/Q2.md): main evaluation criteria in classification (error rate, sensitivity/specificity, ROC curves…) and in regression (squared error, correlation...), evaluation during prediction versus evaluation during training.
3. [**Model evaluation methods**](Questions/Q3.md): motivation, main approaches (resubstitution, test set, cross-validation, leave-one-out, bootstrap), advantages and drawbacks of each method, model selection by cross validation (small and large datasets), selection bias.
4. [**Bias-variance tradeoff**](Questions/Q4.md): bias-variance decomposition (derivation and interpretation of the different terms, link with over- and under-fitting), parameters that influence bias and variance, bias and variance estimation.
5. [**Variance reduction techniques**](Questions/Q5.md): techniques to reduce variance in the context of the different learning algorithms covered in the course (regularization, complexity control, ensemble methods, feature selection), discussion and comparison of the different learning algorithms from the point of view of their bias and variance.
6. **[Classification and regression trees](Questions/Q6.md)**: hypothesis space, growing and pruning algorithms, impurity measures, extensions to regression and continuous attributes, interpretability.
7. [**Linear regression**](Questions/Q7.md): problem formulation, analytical solution, introduction of a regularization term (motivation and modified solution), linear regression with kernels.
8. [**K-Nearest Neighbors methods**](Questions/Q8.md): 1-NN and k-NN algorithms, refinements, relations with tree-based, linear, and kernel methods.
9. [**From single neuron models to multilayer perceptrons**](Questions/Q9.md): single neuron models (batch vs online learning, hard and soft threshold unit, theoretical properties), multilayer perceptrons (definition, representation capacity, general principles of the training algorithm).
10. [**Neural networks**](Questions/Q10.md): multilayer perceptrons (definition, representation capacity, back-propagation, techniques to avoid overfitting)
