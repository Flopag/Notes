# Automata over infinite words: definition, types of acceptance conditions, operations over automata (incl. intersection).

An **automata on infinite words** is a finite state machine that accepts a set of infinite words.

A **Buchi automaton** is a automaton that accepts using only one set of states of [Buchi generalized](Q1.md). To be accepted, the set of state $F$ must be accessed infinitely time. If there is no transition, it is refused.

So, there are two **types of acceptance**:
- Buchi: accepting if the unique set of states is infinitely visited
- [Buchi generalized](Q1.md): accepting if all set of states are infinitely visited
- Rabin, Streett, and Muller: more expressive that the two other in deterministic automata

### Operations of nondeterministic Buchi automatons

The **union operation** is used to accept the languages accepted by one of the two automatons: $A_1 \cup A_2$

This union can be made by only make the union operation on the initial states and the acceptance set of states:
- $S_0 = S_{10} \cup S_{20}$
- $F = F_1 \cup F_2$

The automaton is nondeterministic, so, we have to choose the right one to begin with.

The **intersection operation** is used to accept the languages accepted by the two automatons, both: $A_1 \times A_2$

This intersection can be made by:

1. Creating a generalized Buchi automaton:
	1. Make an union of both
	2. Simulating to make it one (as seen in theory of computation)
	3. Assign colours for each accepting states of the automatons (one colour per automaton)
2. Transform the generalized Buchi automaton to a simple Buchi one. The principle is to make one layer for each color then pass from one to other when the current one is validated:
	1. Multiply the states by the number of set of state in $F$ corresponding to ($state_j$, $F_i$)
	2. for each states ($state_j$, $F_i$), make transition:
		1. if out going an accepting states of the current colour, go to the next state but in the next colour: ($state_{next}$, $F_{next}$) that can be seen as waiting the next colour to appear.
		2. else, go to the next state but in same colour: ($state_{next}$, $F_{current}$) that can be seen as remain waiting
	3. The accepting states $F$ are the one, and only one, of the set of accepting states (one of the colours)
