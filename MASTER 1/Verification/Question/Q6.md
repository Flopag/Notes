# Binary Decision Diagrams: definition, construction, operations on BDDs.

A **Binary Decision Diagram (BDD)** is a data structure for representing symbolically Boolean formulas with a fixed number of free variables. BDD depends of the order of the free variables.

Given a function $f(b_1, b_2, ..., b_k)$, this function can be represented with a full binary tree of depth $k$ where:
- The interior nodes have the value of the label $b_i$ and its outgoing transition are labelled true or false for $b_{i+1}$
	- The root is $b_1$ of depth 0
	- The last interior node is $b_k$ of depth $k$
- The leaves are labelled by true or false. It is the value of the function given the followed path.

This can be constructed by simulating all possible values:

## Reducing BDD

We may want to reduce the BDD so it take less storage when keeping the same information. We can follow the following rules:
1. **Eliminate redundant leaf nodes:** keep only one $true$ and one $false$ leaf
2. **Remove duplicate interior nodes:** if two nodes labelled by the same variable have identical successors, eliminate one of these nodes, and redirect its incoming edges to the other
3. **Remove redundant tests:** if the two successors of a node are identical, eliminate that node and redirect its incoming edges to its unique successor
4. **Remove unreachable nodes**

## Operation on BDD

- Complementation: Swap the $true$ and $false$ leaves
- $\vee$: Simulate both BDD at the same time and create the new one (as done with finite automata)
- $\wedge$: same as above, but if it uses not the same transition, go to $false$ leaf

After doing the operation, we can reduce it again.

With this, we can check some properties:
- Validity: all reduced leaves are $true$
- Satisfiability: at least one $true$ leaf
- Unsatisfiability: all reduced leaves are $false$
