# Model-checking algorithm for LTL: global approach, algorithm for checking the non-emptiness of infinite-word automata.

## Depth-first search

Algorithm:

```
Procedure explore(s):
	St.push(s)
	H := H U {s}
	for all t in enabled(s):
		s' := succ(s,t)
		if ! (s' in H) then:
			explore(s')
	St.pop()

main():
	St := []
	H := empty
	explore(s0)
```

where:
- St is the stack of state to visit children
- H is the hash table of visited states
- enable(s) return all transitions that are enabled in $s$
- succ(s,t) return the state $s'$ that is reach by following transition $t$ from state $s$

## Global approach

The goal of **Model-checking algorithm for LTL** is to check whether all executions of a given FCS satisfy a given LTL property $\varphi$. This can be done by searching that does not being accepted:

1. Build an infinite-word automation $A_{\neg \varphi}$ that accepts exactly tall the infinite sequences that do not satisfy $\varphi$ (as seen [here](Q4.md))
2. Add $A_{\neg\phi}$ as an observer process to the FCS. If needed, add also observer processes for the fairness conditions
3. Explore the corresponding transition system with a depth-first search
4. Check if the observer accepts one infinite sequence. If so, the system does not satisfy the property $\varphi$

## Algorithm for checking the non-emptiness of infinite-word automata

I Buchi automaaton accepts a nonempty language if it has an accepting state that is reachable from an initial state and from itself (loop)

Algorithm:
1. Perform a depth-first search of the reachable states
2. During this search, build a post order list $Q = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_k]$ of the reachable states that are accepting (The children of a node appear before this node)
3. Perform a second search from the states in $Q$. (check whether $Q$ contains a state that is reachable from itself by a path of non-zero length)
	1. Start the search from $s_1$
	2. The search from $s_i$ is finished when either
		1. $s_i$ is reached (loop found, nonemptiness check has succeeded), or
		2. there is no more reachable state to visit (loop not found, restart to $s_{i+1} ignoring already explored states)
	3. If all the $s_i$ have been searched without success, then the nonemptiness check has failed.

The second search works because if a loop would be find using the states already seen, that means that we have missed a loop. We know that there is a path from $s_i$ to $s_j$ where $i > j$. If we found a path that go from a discarded state to $s_i$, that mean that there is a loop $s_i \rightarrow s_j \rightarrow discarded \rightarrow s_i$ this should be detected befor.
