# Symbolic verification: Kripke structures, expressing reachability and repeated reachability in logic.

A Kripke structure is a define as $K=(P,W,R,W_0,L)$ where:
- $P$ is a finite set of atomic propositions. 
- $W$ is a finite set of states. 
- $R$ is transition relation between states
- $W_0$ is a set of initial states. 
- $L$ is a labelling of the states with sets of atomic propositions

**Attention**: the word function has been used, but these are predicates: function that look to condition and return boolean.

These element can be represented using functions:
- For each $p \in P$ and the set of states $w$ such that $p\in L(w)$. $p(b_1b_2...b_n)$ is true iff $b_1b_2...b_n$ encode a state $w$ such that $p \in L(w)$
- $W$ are represented as a bit vector $b_1b_2...b_n$
- $R$ are represented by $R(b_1b_2...b_n, b'_1b'_2...b'_n)$ that is true iff $b_1b_2...b_n$ encode $w$ and $b'_1b'_2...b'_n$ encode $w'$ such that $(w,w')\in R$
- $W_0$ are represented by the function $I(b_1b_2...b_n)$ that is true iff $b_1b_2...b_n$ belong to $W_0$

The Kripke structure can be represented in a language form:
- The set $V=\{x, y, z, ....\}$ are variables that takes states as values
- The seen functions become: $I(x)$, $p(x)$, $R(x,y)$
- The set $V' = \{X, Y, Z, ...\}$ are uninterpreted functions

Examples:
- $\forall x\forall y(p(x) \wedge R(x,y) \Rightarrow \neg q(y) )$: Every transition from $x$ which $p$ is true leads to a state where $q$ is false
- $\forall x(X(x) \Leftrightarrow I(x) \vee \exists y (I(y)\wedge R(x,y)))$: $X$ is true if $x$ is an initial state or directly reachable by an initial state

This language can express recursion:
- $\lambda x_1, x_2, ..., x_k$ are the argument variables (free variables) of the defined function $\prod$
- $\mu X \ A$ mean that $X$ correspond to the least fixpoint (the smaller subset of states) that the monotone function A

## Expressing reachability

The following formula express all the states that are reachable:

$$\mu X \ \lambda x \ (I(x) \vee (X(y) \wedge R(y,x)))$$

- $A = \lambda x \ (I(x) \vee (X(y) \wedge R(y,x)))$: define the function that say if $x$ is the initial states or if $x$ can be reach from a state that is reachable
- $\mu X$: define the smallest subset for $A$
- This is computer going from the initial states then searching for its children

To find all states that have a path that lead to $p = true$:

$$\exists z(I(z) \wedge (\mu X \ \lambda x \ (p(x) \vee (X(y) \wedge R(x,y)))(z))$$

## Expressing repeated reachability

We can define $R⁺(x,y)$ as the function that is true if there is a path from $x$ to $y$:

$$\mu R⁺ \lambda x, y (R(x,y) \vee \exists z ( R(x, z) \wedge R^+(z,y)))$$

The formula can be speed up:

$$\mu R⁺ \lambda x, y (R(x,y) \vee \exists z ( R⁺(x, z) \wedge R^+(z,y)))$$

This can be used to express all accepting states accessible from themself :

$$\lambda x (p(x) \wedge R⁺(x,x))$$
