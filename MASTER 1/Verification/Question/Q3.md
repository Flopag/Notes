# Construction of an automaton representing the models of a LTL formula.

**Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL)** is logical formula using the time dimension. This time dimension can be represented has a path of states followed, each state corresponding to a proposition.

## Temporal Operators

- $\circ \varphi$ **Next**: $\varphi$ is true in the next state
- $\square \varphi = false \ \tilde U \ \varphi$ **Always**: $\varphi$ is true in the current and all future states
- $\diamond \varphi = true \ U \ \varphi$ **Eventually**: $\varphi$ is true in the current state or in, at least, one state in the future
- $\varphi_1 U \varphi_2$ **Until**: $\varphi_1$ is true in the current state and all future states until $\varphi_2$ become true (which must occur)
- $\varphi_1 \tilde{U} \varphi_2$ **Releases**: $\varphi_2$ is true in the current state and all future states until $\varphi_1$ become true (which does not necessarily occur)

## From LTL to automata

The alphabet is of size $2^P$ where $P$ is the number of variables. The alphabet is composed of each combinations of variables, including the empty one $\upphi$.

The **closure formulas $cl(\varphi)$** is the smaller set of formulas, such that:

A **labelling $\tau$** of a sequence $\pi$ is valid if for every position $i\geq 0$ and 

**Sequence labelling rules**:

1. $false \ \notin \tau(i)$
2. For every $p\in P$:
	1. if $p\in \tau(i)$, then $p\in\pi(i)$
	2. if $\neg p \in\tau(i)$, then $p\notin \pi(i)$
3. if $\varphi_1 \wedge \varphi_2 \in \tau(i)$, then $\varphi_1\in \tau(i)$ and $\varphi_2 \in\tau(i)$
4. if $\varphi_1 \vee \varphi_2 \in \tau(i)$, then $\varphi_1\in \tau(i)$ or $\varphi_2 \in\tau(i)$
5. if $\circ \varphi_1\in\tau(i)$, then $\varphi_1\in\tau(i+1)$
6. if $\varphi_1 \ U \ \varphi_2\in\tau(i)$, then either:
	1. $\varphi_2\in\tau(i)$, (stop now) or
	2. $\varphi_1\in\tau(i)$ and $\varphi_1 \ U \ \varphi_2\in\tau(i+1)$ (continue and redo after)
7. if $\varphi_1 \ \tilde U \ \varphi_2\in\tau(i)$, then 
	1. $\varphi_2 \in\tau(i)$, and
	2. either $\varphi_1 \in \tau(i)$, or $\varphi_1 \ \tilde U \ \varphi_2\in\tau(i+1)$ (stop now or continue after)
8. if $\varphi_1 \ U \ \varphi_2\in\tau(i)$, then there exists $j\geq i$ such that $\varphi_2 \in \tau(j)$

To **construct the automaton**:
- States are all association possibilities from $cl(\varphi)$
- Transitions are defined by simulating each of the alphabet
- Acceptance states is when the states must be true (example: $\diamond p \ and \ p$)
- The initial states are the one with $\varphi$

So:
1. Compute $cl(\varphi)$
2. Define the states
3. Make transitions for each state thinking where goes the transition for what character of the alphabet. If a character is not possible, do not make transition
4. Define the acceptances states

Removing redundant transitions can be made by removing transitions that check the following rule:

In other words: keep the transition that gives the more information.
