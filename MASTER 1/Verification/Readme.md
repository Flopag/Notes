# Verification

## First Part

### Questions

1. [Weak and strong fairness: definition, motivation, construction of corresponding observers.](Question/Q1.md)
2. [Automata over infinite words: definition, types of acceptance conditions, operations over automata (incl. intersection).](Question/Q2.md)
3. [Construction of an automaton representing the models of a LTL formula.](Question/Q3.md)
4. Model-checking algorithm for LTL: global approach, algorithm for checking the non-emptiness of infinite-word automata.
5. Symbolic verification: Kripke structures, expressing reachability and repeated reachability in logic.
6. Binary Decision Diagrams: definition, construction, operations on BDDs.
