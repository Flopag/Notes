# What is static single-assignment form (SSA)?Â  Can any program be transformed into SSA? (Slides 5-10 -- 5-13)

SSA is an intermediate representation where all assignment are to variable with distinct names

Using phi function, any program could be transformed into SSA because all turing operation are available (if, jmp, operation, assign)
