## Why are left-recursive grammars a problem with top-down parsers.

Left-recursive means that there is a rule of the form $A\rightarrow Aa$

It can lead in infinite loop if the top down parser is using backtracking 

## How can this be solved, when the grammar is left-recursive because of associative symbols?

We can transform the left-recursive into a right recursive. So, no more loops
