# Sometimes, several rules might have the same prefix, which is typically a problem for top-down parsing, to decide which rule applies.Â  Could you explain a possible solution? (Slide 3-58)

we can combine these rules by using a new non terminal symbol. We make a rule where we go from the non-terminal symbol already define to the common prefix then the new non terminal symbol. We make another other rules that go from this new symbol to each possibilities.
