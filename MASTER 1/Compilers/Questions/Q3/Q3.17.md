# Explain in a few sentences and in your own words how a bottom-up shift-reduce parser works.Â  (Slides 3-66 -- 3-80)

Bottom up means that we determine the tree by reducing the input word (making the invert of rules). Example : $w = acb$ and $C \rightarrow c$, a reduction of $w$ can be $aCb$.

To know what reduction we must do, we use the principle of the handle. The handle is the left most rule and location that can do not block the bottom up process. The right side of the handle must only contains only terminal symbol. 

We can separate the input in two parts:
- On the left : the work string where we reduce (is a LIFO)
- On the right : the non processed string

In the shift-reduce, there are two operations :
- Shift : get the first character on the non-process string (right side) and add it on the end of the work string (left side)
- Reduce : reduce the handle
- Accept : parsing completed
- Error : an error is detected

The next operation will depends of the current work string and the first character of the non processed string. This is not always possible to choose the right operation to do.

There are two categories of shift-reduce parser:
- LR-parser
- Weak precedence parser
