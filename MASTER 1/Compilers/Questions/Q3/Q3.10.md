# What is left/right-associativity of an operator? (Slide 3-22)Â  Why is it useful to consider an associative operator to be only left or right associative? (Slide 3-23)

## What is left/right-associativity of an operator? 

The left/right associativity if the expression must be evaluated from left to right/right to left

example :
- left associative : (1+1) + 1
- right associative : 1 + (1+1)

## Why is it useful to consider an associative operator to be only left or right associative?

That permit to transform a ambiguous grammar into a non-ambiguous one. This is made by making recursion. Example :
