# Give an example of a language that can be represented by a  context-free grammar and not a regular one.Â  (Slide 3-13)

The language ${a^nb^n, n > 0}$ cannot be represented by a regular grammar but well with a CFG.

The CFG is :
- $S \rightarrow aSb$
- $S \rightarrow \varepsilon$

In the syntax analysis context, regular grammar cannot  handle parenthesis, CFG can.
