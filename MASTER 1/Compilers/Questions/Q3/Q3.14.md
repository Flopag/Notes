## What is an LL(1) grammar?

A grammar is LL(1) if a top down predictive parsing is possible. More precicely : 
- L for left-to-right scan
- L for left most deviation
- (1) for one lookahead

A top down predictive parsing is when we parse the word always using the rule that permit to match the beginning of the current target (without using backtracking).

## How does this relates to top-down parsing?

Using such grammar, we can parse a code by making a table. and simply by following it. If we have the table, the method is much more efficient that backtracking that can have loop and make random guess.

For this, we look to the first symbol of the word and the current non terminal symbol. Then, we transform this non terminal symbol using the rule corresponding to both (first symbol of the word and the current non terminal symbol)

If we the grammar is not LL(1), we can transform into one.
