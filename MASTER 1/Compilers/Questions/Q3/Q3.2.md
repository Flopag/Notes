# Assuming we know what a grammar is, what is the particularity of a  regular grammar?Â  A context-free grammar? (Slide 3-12)

A regular grammar is equivalent with a regular finite automaton. It can only contains rules of type :
- $X \rightarrow a$
- $X \rightarrow aX$ or $X \rightarrow Xa$ (but not both!)

A context-free grammar (CFG) is equivalent with a pushdown finite automata. CFG permit to express more languages than the regular grammar (e.g. $a^nb^n$), usually, symmetric languages.It can only contains types of type :
- $X \rightarrow \alpha$ where $\alpha$ is arbitrary
