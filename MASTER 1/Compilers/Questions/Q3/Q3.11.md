# What parsing problem (called dangling else) is linked to parsing of if-then(-else), and how to solve it?Â  (Slides 3-25, 3-26, 3-58)

In the if-then-else operation, the else part is optional. So, we can have if without else and with else that are nested. How to know which else correspond to which if?

solutions :
- use of a convention : else matches the closest if that has no else yet
- use of left factorising : see [Q3.16](Q3.16.md)
