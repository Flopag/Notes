# Could you cite a few examples of things that are commonly used in programming languages but that are not captured by context-free grammars? (Slide 3-28)  How is this typically solved?  Why not simply go for more expressive grammars?

## Could you cite a few examples of things that are commonly used in programming languages but that are not captured by context-free grammars?

All things that are using context cannot be capture by a context free grammar. For example:
- is the variable declare?
- is the function declare?
- are the arguments of the function correct?
- is the return value correct?

## How is this typically solved?

These things are solved in the semantics analysis part (using Turing machine)

## Why not simply go for more expressive grammars?

because it is too complex to do (?)
