# What are the Chomsky's types for context-free grammars and regular  grammars?  What does it mean for a grammar to have a small/large  Chomsky's type w.r.t. automation and expressivity?  Where are, in the  Chomsky's hierarchy, the languages that can be decided (i.e. such that  there is program that always terminates and decides whether some text  belongs to the language or not). (Slide 3-12)

## What are the Chomsky's types for context-free grammars and regular  grammars?

- Context-free grammars $\rightarrow$ Type 2
- Regular grammars $\rightarrow$ Type 3

## What does it mean for a grammar to have a small/large  Chomsky's type w.r.t. automation and expressivity?

The more the Champsky's type is small, the more the grammars can express different languages. But, also, the more the grammars is complex to automate.

## Where are, in the  Chomsky's hierarchy, the languages that can be decided (i.e. such that  there is program that always terminates and decides whether some text  belongs to the language or not).
