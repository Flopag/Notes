# Are there words that only have left-most derivations? (Slide 3-15)

We can see the application of the rules as a tree. Each branch can be developed independently of the order. So, there is no word that can only derive using left-most approach

For example, to get the word accacbb with the grammar :
- $S \rightarrow aTb \ | \ c$
- $T \rightarrow cSS \ | \ S$

We get the following tree:

In this tree, we can see that the order of execution is not important. What's important is the chosen children of each node.
