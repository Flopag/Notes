# Is the parse tree unique?  How do you call a grammar such that parse  trees are unique?  Should we enforce working only with such grammars?  (Slides 3-18 -- 3-20, 3-125)


## is the parse tree unique?

No, there is multiple parse tree that can give the same word. For example, lets consider 2 + 3 * 4 , here are two possibles tree :

## How do you call a grammar such that parse  trees are unique?  

A grammars where parse trees are not unique are called ambiguous. So, grammars where parse trees are unique are called non-ambiguous.

## Should we enforce working only with such grammars?

No, non-ambiguous grammar are too complex. Using a ambiguous grammar with side condition (give priority to some rules) is a more natural and easy way to handle ambiguous situation.
