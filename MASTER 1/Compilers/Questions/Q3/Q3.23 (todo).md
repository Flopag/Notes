# But I assume you can explain how to remove an epsilon rule from a grammar (Slide 3-122), how to fix ambiguous grammars with precedence rules (Slide 3-125) and all practicalities at the end of the chapter about Syntax analysis.Â  If the subject comes up, I might ask easy questions, but I will not particularly target this.
