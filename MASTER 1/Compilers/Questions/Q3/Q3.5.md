# What is a left-most/right-most derivation of a context-free grammar?  (Slide 3-15)

Because there is only non terminal symbols on the left side of the rules, the order of execution does not change the result, but the chosen rules are. So, we can use the rules following :
- left-most : first develop the non terminal symbol on the left
- right-most: first develop the non terminal symbol on the right

Both will given the same result. Bit left-most is natural for parsing because we can choose the new rule by following the token of list from left to right (from the beginning to the end)
