## Describe in your own words what `Nullable(alpha)`, `First(alpha)` and `Follow(A)` are, where `alpha` is a sequence of symbols, and `A` a non-terminal.

- $Nullable(\alpha)$ is true if $\alpha$ can be $\varepsilon$, is false else
- $First(\alpha)$ is the set of terminal symbol that can be the first symbol of $\alpha$ (must look at all possibilities)
- $Follow(A)$ is the set of terminal symbol that can be the next terminal symbol after $A$ (must look at all possibilities)

## How can this help to build a top-down parser?

This permit to construct a the table of a LL(1) grammar or verify if the grammar is LL(1). 

To construct the table, we must :
1. Start with the empty table
	1. add $A \rightarrow \alpha$ to $M[A, a]$ for each terminal $a$ in $First(\alpha)$
	2. if $Nullable(\alpha)$ then add $A \rightarrow \alpha$ to $M[A, a]$ for each $a$ in $Follow(A)$

The grammar is LL(1) if the table contains at most one rules for each entry of the table.
