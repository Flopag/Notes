# Given a configuration of an LR parser, what information give the `Action` and `Goto` tables? (Slides 3-85, 3-86, see also examples slides 3-87, 3-88)

Action table gives the action to make given the current state and the first symbol on the non-processed string. These actions can be :
- Shift : put the first symbol of the non-processed string on the stack with the associated state (given by the action table)
- Reduce : reduction of the first elements of the stack with the new non terminal symbol and the state given by the Goto table
- Accept : the parsing is accepted
- Error : an error is detected

The Goto table gives the new state for the reduce process
