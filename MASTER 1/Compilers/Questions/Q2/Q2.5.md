# How to use for a lexer a deterministic finite automaton representing a  language? (Slides 2-36 -- 2-37)

It use the same principle as the lexer using NFA (see [Q2.3](Q2.3.md)). But the NFA is converted to a DFA and tokens are put into the new corresponding final states.

The complexity is independent of the number of states because we don't have to search to into all the possibilities with DFA. We directly get the next and unique state $\rightarrow O(1)$.
