# Explain how lexical analysis should be tweaked to handle languages  where blocks are indentation based. (Slide 2-43)

The lexical analyser maintains a stack of indentation to follow the block. So, it will make a new token for a new indentation (indent) and a new token for a return to the previous indentation (dedent). With this, we recognise blocks using indent and dedent tokens.
