# Why is semantic analysis required?Â  That is, why all this is not captured in the syntax analysis? (See e.g. slide 3-28, 4-5)

It is not capture in the syntax analysis because some programming functionalities (as variable instantiation) cannot be captured by context-free grammars.

The semantic analysis permit to give more informations to the syntax tree. For example : types. And report semantics errors.
