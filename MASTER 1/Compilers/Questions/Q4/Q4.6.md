# What does *syntactic sugar* means?Â  What shall we do with it in the compiler and why? (Slide 4-32)

a syntactic sugar is a syntax that ease the writing or the reading with a sort of short cut (e.g. i++)

In the compiler, it is a good idea to transform these syntactic sugar to their original form (e.g. i++ to i = i + 1) to ease the implementation of the compiler. If we do not that, we must handle multiple syntax for the same behavior
