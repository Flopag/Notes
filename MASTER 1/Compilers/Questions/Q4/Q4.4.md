# In the context of syntax-directed definitions, where you have both synthesized and inherited attributes, what kind of problems could you face (solution: dependency cycles), and how to solve that? (solution: for instance only synthesized attributes, or L-attributed grammar, where attributes can be computed by a Euler-tour traversal, or in general, make sure a topological order exists) (Slides 4-13 -- 4-15)

## what kind of problems could you face

The dependency graph could have cycles. These cycle avoid to find a topological order.

## how to solve that?

We can solve that using :
- S-attributed : a grammar that only contains synthesized attributes. the attributes can be evaluated bottom up, so, no loop possible
- L-attributed : a grammar where each attributes are either synthesized or inherited from the left. The attributes will only depend on the left attribute, the propagation is from left to right. So, no loop possible
