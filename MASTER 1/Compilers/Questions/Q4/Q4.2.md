# What is a syntax-directed definition? (Slide 4-8)Â  Could you provide an easy example? (See for instance slide 4-9: the SDD gives clear rules to compute the numbers of a's and c's)

## What is a syntax-directed definition?

syntax-directed definition (SDD) is a way to associate action to context-free rules

SDD associate :
- attributes to each symbol (values)
- a set of semantic rules to each grammar rule (values modifier)

## Could you provide an easy example?

we want to count the number of $a$ of a given word $w$. We can consider the rule :
- $S \rightarrow aS_1$
- $S \rightarrow \varepsilon$

the corresponding semantic rule :
- $S.n_a \leftarrow S_1.n_a + 1$
- $S.n_a \leftarrow 0$

where $n_a$ the value corresponding to the number of $a$

with these rules, we get the number of $a$ bellow each nodes
