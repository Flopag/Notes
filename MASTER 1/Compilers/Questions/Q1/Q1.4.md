# Why do we use an intermediate representation in compilers? (Slides 1-10, 1-11, 5-6)

There is three stage in the compiler:
- front-end: transform the source language into the intermediate language
- intermediate: optimise the intermediate language
- back-end: transform the intermediate code into the destination language

The intermediate language (e.g. llvm) permits to have more modularity. We can easily change the source language or the destination language by modifying the frond-end or the back-end.

So, for a given intermediate language, there is only one frond-end compiler or one back-end compiler for each language.
