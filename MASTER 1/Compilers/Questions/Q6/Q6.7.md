# What are the heap and the stack?Â  Where do global variables go? What about local variables for a function, or an array of integer allocated using malloc? (Slides 6-53 -- 6-56)

## What are the heap and the stack?

The heap stores functions call (args, variables, previous SP, previous PC)

The stack stores all data allocation (dynamic data usage)

## Where do global variables go?

Global variable are stored in the static data because these are know to be defined in compilation time and it is not attached to a function (cannot be on the heap)

## What about local variables for a function, or an array of integer allocated using malloc?

In general, if the variable properties are known at compilation time and that the scope of the variable is limited to the function, it will be an the heap. Other wise, it will be on the stack (because data is dynamic)
