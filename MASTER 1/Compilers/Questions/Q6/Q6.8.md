# How can garbage collection be implemented with reference counting? (Slide 6-63 -- 6-65)

The base idea is to free all block that does not have any pointer that point to it

To know it there is a pointer that point to it, we introduce a value that follows these rules :
- At the instantiation of the block, the value is 0
- If a new pointer to this block is made, increment the number
- if a pointer is removed, decrement the number
- if the number is 0 (and not in instantiation phase), free the block
