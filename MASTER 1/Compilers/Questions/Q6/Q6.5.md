# How is register allocation (when translating intermediate language into assembly) related to graph colouring?Â  (understand the high level idea of slides 6-36 -- 6-45)

Live variables are variables that may be used in the future

Dead variables are variable that will not be used in the future

So, two variables can use the same register if both are never Live at the same time

To find these variables, we can construct a graph where nodes are variables and links are between variables that are live at the same time. We want to give a register to each node but two neighbour cannot have the same register.

This problem is exactly the same as the graph colouring.

To construct the graph, we look at live and dead variable of each instruction, an we make a table to summarise it.
