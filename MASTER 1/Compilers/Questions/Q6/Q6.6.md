# Describe in a few words Chaitin's algorithm for graph colouring. (Slides 6-46 -- 6-49)

The number of available colours is k

Steps of the algorithm:
1. Remove the node that have less than k neighbours (because if we know the colour of the neighbours, we know the colour of the node)
	1. If no node that have less than k neighbours : remove a random node (but may not find a solution)
2. Find the colours of the rest of the graph (using recursion on step 1)
3. Give a colour to the removed node:
	1. if the only node of the graph : give random colour
	2. if others nodes on the graph : give a valid colour
	3. if no valid colour : the colour is spilled (is correspond to store variable in memory)
