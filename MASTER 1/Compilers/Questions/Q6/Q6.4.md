# Could you provide a naive, yet working, way to circumvent the problem of scarce registers when translating intermediate language into assembly? (Slides 6-34 -- 6-35)

All intermediate registers are in the main memory. For each instruction, we load all needed intermediate register into machine registers, execute the instruction, store all machine register in intermediate register in the main memory.

It is very simple to implement but there is a lot of overhead
