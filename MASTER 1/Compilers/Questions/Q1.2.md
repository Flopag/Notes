# How do you compare compiling and interpreting? (Slides 1-6, 1-7)

**Compiler** will transform a source code into a destination code. Then, the destination code will receive inputs and give outputs. (e.g. C)

**Interpreter** will receive inputs and source code at the same time and provide directly outputs. (e.g. python)

**Hybrid** will compile a source code into a intermediate code. Then, interpret this intermediate code. (e.g. java)
