1. [Q1](Questions/Q1.md) Show that the set of all languages is not countable
2. Show that if a language is accepted by a regular expression, it is accepted by a nondeterministic finite automaton
3. [Q3](Questions/Q3.md) Show that if a language is generated by a regular grammar, it is regular
4. Show that if $L$ is a context-free language, there exists $K$ such that for any word $w \in L$ with $|w|$ can be written as $w=uvxyz$ with $|vxy|\leq K$ and $uv^nxy^n \in L$ for all $n \geq 0$
5. Show that, given a context-free grammar $G$, there exists an algorithm that determines whether a given word $w \in L(G)$
6. Show that any language accepted by a nondeterministic Turing machine is also accepted by a deterministic Turing machine
7. Show that there exist computable functions that are not primitive recursive
8. Show that if $L \in RE$ and $\bar L \in RE$, then $L\in R$ and $\bar L  \in R$
9. Show that, for any language $L$ accepted by a Turing machine $M$, there exists a grammar that generates it
10. Show that we can generate in sequence all words accepted by a Turing machine
