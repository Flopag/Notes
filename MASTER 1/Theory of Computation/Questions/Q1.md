> Show that the set of all languages is not countable

The proof is done by contradiction (**Cantor diagonal**)

We can see all languages in form of a table with $a_i = 0$ or $1$ :

We want to enumerate a new language $S_n$ that is not yet in the list. To do it, we can take $1$ if $(S_i, a_i) = 0$ and $0$ if $(S_i,a_i) = 1$. No problem from $(S_n, a_0)$ to $(S_n, a_{n-1})$. But for $(S_n, a_n)$, there is a contradiction. It cannot be $1$ or $0$ because it if it is $1$, it must be $0$ (and vice versa)
