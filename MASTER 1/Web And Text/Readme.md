## Big summary (following [this](exam_content_notes.md))

### Document scoring

- [Jaccard index](Slide_notes/Info_Retrieval_and_VSM.md) : 
	- is overlapping of two sets : computed by counting the number of elements that appear in the two sets divided by the number of elements in the rest
	- Limitations : do not take occurrence and do not normalize documents length
- [Vector space model (VMS)](Slide_notes/Info_Retrieval_and_VSM.md) :
	- One vector per document
	- Count the number of occurrence of a word in the document (can be $0$)
	- Words are dimensions and their occurrence are the length of the vector in this dimension
- [Proximity Metric](Slide_notes/Info_Retrieval_and_VSM.md) : 
	- Measure the distance between two VMS
	- by Euclidean distance ($d_{euc} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n ( x_i - y_i )^2}$) : penalize large vectors
	- by angular distance ($\theta = \cos^{-1} {\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i}{||x|| \ ||y||}}$) : do not penalize large vectors, only look to relevant dimensions (words)
		- size of a vector is computed using $||x|| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}$

## [Term-Frequency Inverse-Document Frequency (TFIF)](Slide_notes/TFIDF.md)

- Term-frequency : the more mentions of a query is, the more relevant the document is
	- Documents with most words same as query have most values
	- Limitations : unimportant terms will grow the score (as "the")
- Inverse-Document Frequency : the less mentions of a query there is in all documents, the more relevant term is
	- Overall rare words have more values
- TFIF : combination of both
	- $TFIDF_{t, d} = tf_{t,d} \times \log \frac{N}{df_t}$
	- Where :
		- $tf_{t,d}$ is the number of occurrence of term $t$ in document $d$ (term frequency)
		- $df_t$ is the number of occurrence of term $t$ in all documents
		- $N$ is the number of documents of the collection

## [Text classification - Features selection](Slide_notes/text_classification.md)

- is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features from the full set of features of the dataset
	- Feature = value given as input
- Two types of methods :
	- Linguistic methods : Identify features based on linguistic information (e.g. grammar)
	- Statical methods : Identify features based on the occurrence frequency
		- TFIDF (see above)
		- Mutual information : the amount of information that the term contains about the class (see [here](Slide_notes/text_classification.md) to get formula)
		- Chi-square : the amount of dependence between events (see [here](Slide_notes/text_classification.md) to get formula)
			- big values is big dependence
		- Multinomial Naïve Bayes : predict the best class given a document
			- It is naïve because it makes two assumptions to facilitate probability computations :
				- Each text document is generated by a mixture model
					- A mixture model models data using several statistical distributions
					- So, documents are generated using statistical distributions
				- There is a one to one mapping between each mixture component and the document class
					- A mixture component is a distribution used in the mixture model
					- So, each class is associated to a statistical distribution
			- it is good for text classification because it do good comparisons between class despite that it does deliver un accurate solo values
				- Good because robust, efficient and easy

## [Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)](Slide_notes/RNN.md)

- are neural networks where the neurones are trained using backpropagation trough time and process sequential data (RNN remembers information, basic NN don't)
- Three types of layer : Input, Hidden, Output
- Propagation of states : $h_t = f_W(h_{t-1}, x_t)$
	- for basic RNN, use of : $f_W(h_{t-1}, x_t) = tanh(W_{hh}h_{t-1} + W_{xh}x_t)$
- Output : $y_t = W_{hy}h_t$
	- Many to One : output one value at the end of the sequence of inputs
	- One to Many : output multiple value for one input
	- Many to many : output multiple values for multiple inputs
		- output for each input
		- output time not related to input time
- Output is used to compute the loss and then back propagate
- Backpropagation trough time (BPTT) : back propagation but trough states (time) instead of only trough layers
	- Each back propagation, the weights are updated doing a sort of memory
- Sequence to Sequence architecture (Seq2Sec)
	- Used in machine translation
	- Combination of encoder-decoder, decoder gets output of encoder as input
	- Encoder : 
		- Many to one
		- Output the context vector from input (if use of [softmax](Slide_notes/Word_Embeddings.md), it becomes a probability distribution)
	- Decoder :
		- One to many
		- Output the sequence given the context vector from encoder
- Vanishing gradient : The gradient can vanish trough time due to backpropagation
	- Back propagation can divide some value until vanishing
	- The inverse is called exploding gradient
	- Can be fixed using : LSTM or GRU
		- LSTM : introduction of memory cells and gates that control the flow of information
		- Four gates : control how much information is passed through or removed from the memory cell. They consist of sigmoid (output between 0 and 1)
			- Forget gate : how much information from the previous cell state to forget
			- Input gate : how much new information to add to the memory cell
			- Output gate : how much of the memory cell to pass to the output
		- Prevent vanishing gradient tanks to the only use of the Forget gates that have a value between 0 and 1, smoother gradient flow

## [Machine translation evaluation](Slide_notes/MT_Evaluation.md)

- Evaluation aim to determine how good is a machine translation system
- Two kinds of translation quality :
	- Adequacy : is the meaning kept ?
	- Fluency : is the grammar correct ?
- Human evaluation : not so good because a lot of subjectivity
- Precision-Recall : look at words that are exactly the same than in reference
	- $F1$-score computed making the proportion of word in both text
	- Bad, do not look at the meaning, only words is important not their position
- Word Error Rate (WER) : look at the number of steps needed to go from output text to reference
	- Each type of steps (substitution, insertion, deletion) have a fixed value
	- This can be computed by finding the less costly path between both texts
- BLEU : look at clusters similitude between output text and reference
	- $BLEU_4 = \min\left(1, \frac{output length}{reference length}\right) \left(\prod_{i=1}^4 precision_i\right)^{\frac 1 4}$
	- BLEU-1 is the same as precision-recall because the cluster size are of one word
	- Limitation : it overlook the semantics and the meaning can be fault. (see [example](Slide_notes/MT_Evaluation.md))
