# Describe the concepts of horizontal scaling, CAP, and BASE. How are these concepts related?

## Horizontal scaling

Horizontal scaling is the concept of adding nodes to distributed NoSQL database to scale it. This is the inverse of vertical scaling of SQL databases that consist of upgrading a single node.

## CAP

The CAP theorem say that it is impossible for a distributed database to guaranty simultaneous : 
- Consistency : Every read request receives the most recent write or update
- Availability : Every request receives a response, without regard to the state of the system
- Partition tolerance : The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped by the network between nodes

For distributed system, Partition tolerance is mandatory because failure always occurs. So, we can just manipulate consistency and availability :
- Maximising consistency lead to a strong but slow database
- Maximising availability lead to fast but weak database

## BASE

We know that we can not guarantee consistency in a distributed database. BASE gives a guarantee of relaxed consistency. It's not full guarantee but nearly full guarantee. BASE is :
- Basically Available : we guarantee availability
- Soft-state : the state of the database can change over time
- Eventually consistent : consistency is archived over time. So, after some times, the database converge in all nodes
