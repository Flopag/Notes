# What is the “definition” of NoSQL, and what is the motivation behind the movement and technologies?


NoSQL is all databases that are not using SQL (relational databases)

NoSQL is useful to store data without strict schema. That give more flexibility at the cost of expressivity. That permit to store large amount of data in a distributed manner using complex and involving structures.

NoSQL have some characteristics :
- Horizontal scalability : NoSQL is design to scale by adding nodes instead of upgrading nodes. That permit to use concurrency to compute more efficiently
- High performance and low latency : NoSQL is suitable for real time data management
- Flexible data storage and processing : support a wide range of data storage
