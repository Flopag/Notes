# Describe the key characteristics of XXX, including their data model, querying capabilities, possibilities, and limitations. Provide the name of a XXX database and explain how it differs from a relational database.

## XXX = Document stores

### Data model

Document stores are hierarchical and stores object or array of object by giving tags to them. For example : json. We can see that as documents that are nested.

### Querying capabilities

/

### Possibilities

 - fast data access
 - highly scalable
 - storing unstructure data
 - need high levels of concurrency
 - real time data processing

### Limitations

- concurrent writing is fast on multiple document but not in one document
- retrieving data withing a document is fast but not in multiple document

## XXX = Graph stores

### Data model

### Querying capabilities

### Possibilities

### Limitations

## XXX = Column-family stores

### Data model

Data is stored in tables made of rows and columns. Each row has a unique key. Column are grouped in families. Each column has its how data type. Each row can have different columns. 

In column-familiy, each family is stored in separated files

### Querying capabilities

/

### Possibilities

- Because each family is stored in its own file, that ease the aggregate process within a family
- Permit to write a lot of data in a distributed way
- fast data access
- highly scalable
- storing unstructure data
- need high levels of concurrency
- real time data processing

### Limitations

- have to denormilise data and data redundancy

## XXX = Key-Value stores

### Data model

Each piece of data is stored as a key value pair. The key is a unique for the value.

### Querying capabilities

Query are simple get, delete, put operation on keys

### Possibilities

- useful for simple data storage as:
	- caching
	- storing web session
	- storing analytics data

### Limitations

- The set a key is limited but the set of value is not. So, we may want to store more value than the number of keys

## Provide the name of a XXX database and explain how it differs from a relational database.
