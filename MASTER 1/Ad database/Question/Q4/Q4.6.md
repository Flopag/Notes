# Explain the concept of eventual consistency in distributed NoSQL databases. How does the concept of consistency differ in ACID?

Eventual consistancy is a property of distributed system where all nodes must agree on a state (a consensus). With this, we can perform write in multiple nodes, the state will be updated in all other nodes using consensus. So, consistency in guaranty after the time needed to converge the state in all nodes.

ACID consistency mean that data in a state will be valid. Consistency in CAP mean that all node have the same state (read the last write)
