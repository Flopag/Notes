# Discuss the trade-offs of choosing a NoSQL database over a relational database. When would it be appropriate to choose a NoSQL database over a relational database, and why? Conversely, when would it be appropriate to choose a relational database over a NoSQL database?

Trade-offs:
- More flexible but require a strong model
- faster but redundant
- May not be consistent

When choose SQL?
- Fixed schema
- Need ACID
- want easy and safe database building

When choose NoSQL?
- Need fast response
- Need a flexible schema
- Want to scale up in low price
