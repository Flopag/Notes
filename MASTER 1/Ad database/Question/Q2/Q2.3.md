# When modeling data for a GIS, one needs to model the data using three important concepts. What are those concepts, and how are they related? Provide an example illustrating the role of each concept

## Spacial data

Spacial data is the information of the localisation of objects (points, zone, line, etc).

These localisation can be represented as vectors or raster (see [Q2.2](Q2.2.md) for more information)

For example, spacial data can describe country as zones, and city as point

## Attribute data

Attribute data is information about what can be found at a particular location. This can be linked to spacial data to give information to it.

For example : we can give the number of house (attribute data) to each country (spacial data)

## Metadata

Metadata is data about data. It can be linked to spacial or/and attribute data to give more information about the data itself.

For example : we can give the hour (metadata) when the number of house (attribute data) has been counted
