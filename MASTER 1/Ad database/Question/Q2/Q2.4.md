## What is a spatial coordinate system?

A coordinate system defines the position of points in a defined space. 

## How are they used in a coordinate reference system?

Coordinate reference system (CRS) combines spatial coordinate system with fixed reference points (datum) to compute relative distance.  

## Why are spatial coordinate systems not sufficient in GIS?

The earth is not perfectly round, so, we need some reference point (datum) to calibrate the coordinate system. 

Let's imagine that we don't use reference point, how can i know where is my point if i don't have any origin (or equivalent) to my coordinate system? impossible!
