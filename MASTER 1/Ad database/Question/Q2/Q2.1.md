# What are geospatial databases, and how do they differ from traditional databases (both conceptual and physical)? Give an example of a use case for a geospatial database, and explain how it represents, stores, and uses the spatial data

## What are geospatial databases?

geospatial database is the part of the geographic information system (GIS) that manage geographic data. 

So, a geospatial database is any kind of database that contains :
- geospatial data types
- spatial predicates
- spatial functions

## How do they differ from traditional databases?

Geospatial database provide geospatial data types and spacial predicates and functions. It permit to directly manipulate spatial datatype using the database instead of getting data from traditional database then process it.

## Example of a use case for a geospatial database

Geospatial database can be used to store all routes on the earth with their name, location, and speed limitation.

## How it represents, stores, and uses the spatial data?

The data is represented using specific datatypes as vector or raster (see [Q2.2](Q2.2.md) for more information).

These data (and corresponding objects) can be stored using specific indexes :
- Space driven ones : the space is divided in zones and sub-zones with objects in it
- Data driven ones : the objects are grouped using envelopes (approximation of objects)

These data are used by using functions
