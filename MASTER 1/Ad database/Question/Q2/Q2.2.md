## Describe how a geospatial database extends a database.

Geospatial database extends a basic database by providing some features:
- geospatial data types
- geospatial predicates
- geospatial functions

These new feature can be added to an already existing database as a extension

## What are two ways to represent geospatial data?

### Vector data

(can be compared with vectored image as svg)

There is two types of vector data :
- Primitives (base types) :
	- Point : coordinate
	- Line strings : multiple linked points
	- Polygons : close line segment
- Composite (composition of priitives) :
	- Multipoint : set of points
	- Multi-line string : set of lines
	- Multypoligon : set of polygons
	- Geometry collection : set of whatever primitives

### Raster data

(can be compared with pixel images as png)

represents geographic features by dividing the space into discrete square or rectangular cells in a grid. The values are contains in these cells.
