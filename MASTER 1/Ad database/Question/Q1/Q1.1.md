## What is a deductive database, and how does it differ from a traditional relational database?

> A deductive database is a database system that computes deductions (i.e. deducing additional facts) based on rules (logical formulas) and stored facts.

- queries:
	- relational : the query says how to compute the wanted data
	- deductive : the query says what to compute

## Explain Datalog's basic concepts and syntax, and give an example of a rule-based program that can be expressed using Datalog.

- a term can be a variable (e.g. X, Y, Z, ..) or a constant (e.g. anna, bob, chris, ..) 
- a predicative symbole can be :
	- a base (extensional) predicate (e.g. parent) (informations)
	- a derived (intentional) predicate (e.g. grandparent) (rules)
	- an arithmetic relation (e.g. >)
- an atomic formula, literal, or atom is of the form $p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_n)$ where $p$ is a predicative symbol and $t_1, t_2, ..., t_n$ are arguments (e.g. parent(bob, dan))
- An atom is a grounded atom if it does not contain any variable
- A rule (e.g. grandparent(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), parent(Z, Y))
- Atomic clause or facts are rules without a body (e.g. parent(l√©opold, albert))
