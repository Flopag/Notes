# We have seen two conditions that rules and sets of rules must abide by. Name those conditions, and explain and illustrate their importance.

The conditions are :
1. Predicates appearing in the head are only used for defining intensional predicates.
2. Any variable used in a rule must appear in at least one atom of the body whose predicate represents a relation and which is not negated.

These conditions permit to ensure that the evaluation of rules is possible (prevent infinite results)
