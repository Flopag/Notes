# How do dimension tables change over time? Describe SCD0 to SCD1, mentioning their advantages and disadvantages.

## SCD0

SCD 0 means that the values do not change

## SCD1

SCD 1 means replace the old value by the new one

- +
	- Easy to implement
- -
	- Loose historical data

## SCD2

SCD 2 means add a new row with the new value and set the old row as inactive.

- +
	- Easy track of history (because of the use of the inactive attribute)
	- flexible
- -
	- A lot of over head if there is no much change in dimension
	- Harder to find the last entry (because must check all entry corresponding to a key)

## SCD3

SCD 3 means add a new attribute (column) with the new value.

- +
	- Easy to find the last entry (because just need to check the new attribute)
- -
	- Less flexible (must create a new column for each attribute that can change)
	- Harder track of hystory (less metadata and limited number of attributes)
