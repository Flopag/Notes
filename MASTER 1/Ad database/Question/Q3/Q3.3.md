# We have seen two approaches to building and using a data warehouse. What are the two approaches and their advantages and disadvantages?

## Relational Online Analytical Processing (ROLAP)

The data is stored in a relational database

- +
	- scalability
	- easy change of structure and dimensions
	- reduce hardware and software cost
- -
	- Slower for complex queries
	- offer less analytical capabilities

## Multidimensional Online Analytical Processing (MOLAP)

The data is preprocessed and store in a multidimensional database

- +
	- Fast queries
	- build-in analytical functionalities
- -
	- no scalable
	- hard to change structure (need processing)
	- multidimensional database cost more
